All HTML elements can be visualized as boxes. The term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The box model is a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: the actual content, padding, borders, and margins. This can be set by using the <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span> property in CSS.The <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span> property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not. The image below illustrates the box model:

<!-- Explanation Of the Different Parts -->
<!-- ================================== -->

## Explanation of the different parts

* Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
* Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
* Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
* Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.

The <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span> property can be set as:

* <span class="code code--blue">content-box</span>: Default. The <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span> properties (and min/max properties) includes only the content. Border and padding are not included.

* <span class="code code--blue">border-box</span>: The <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span> properties (and min/max properties) includes content, padding and border.

* <span class="code code--blue">initial</span>: Sets this property to its default value.

* <span class="code code--blue">inherit</span>: Inherits this property from its parent element.

## Box Model Practice
what do you think this div's width will be?
<p class="title--file">html</p>
```html
<div>
  woo a div
</div>
```
<p class="title--file">css</p>
```css
div {
  border: 4px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
  width: 200px;
}
```

The width is going to be 228px.

Here is the calculation:
<br>200px (width)
<br>+ 20px (left + right padding)
<br>+ 8px (left + right border)
<br>+ 0px (left + right margin)
<br>= 228px

This is because The <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span> property defines how the width and height of an element are calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not. Since we did not declare a <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span>, it will default to <span class="code code--blue">content-box</span>. The width and height of an element's border or padding will be added to the final rendered width and height.

The total width of an element will be calculated like this:

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin

The total height of an element will be calculated like this:

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin

This means that when you set width and height, you have to adjust the value you give to allow for any border or padding that may be added.

what do you think this div's width will be?
<p class="title--file">html</p>
```html
<div>
  woo another div
</div>
```
<p class="title--file">css</p>
```css
div {
  border: 3px solid red;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 40px;
  width: 200px;
}
```

The width is going to be 200px.

Since we declared the <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span> to <span class="code code--blue">border-box</span>, it's width and height will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width.

This usually makes it much easier to size elements.

## Conclusion

I think that everyone should declare the <span class="code code--blue">box-sizing</span> property to <span class="code code--blue">border-box</span> on all elements so they don't have to worry about the padding and border adding to the rendered width and height.
